# Click 3 Points

Click 3 Points was an interactive and community art piece that was floating around the web in 2001. This project contains my "DHTML" port of the original Flash 5 ActionScript based components.

I am a pack rat, and never delete anything digital. This is an archival project shared for historical purposes. It is not intended for ongoing development.

<p>You are here because you ran into a javascript error. This &quot;Click Three Points&quot; exibition contains extensive use of standards based dhtml.</p>

<p>There are no hacks here, there is no bending over for legacy browsers that don't support standard code. Known browsers that Click Three Points works in are MS Internet Explorer 5+, Netscape 6+ and recent Mozilla releases.</p>

<p>If you think you have a 'recent' browser and indeed that it's my code that is bad, then <strong>please</strong> email me at <a href="mailto:cac6982@placenamehere.com" style="color:rgb(245,180,180);">cac6982@placenamehere.com</a>. Hate mail is also accepted.</p>
